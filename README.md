# zomato

This is a web scraping project. I scraped against zomato.com. Like previous projects, it's a job offer from upwork.com. Please read the details in files named 'zamato job offer.png' or 'zamato job offer.txt'.  

First plan, I used Requests and BeautifulSoup. As you can see in file named 'access denied.png', it failed.

So I used Selenium. It works fine.

Please give me your advices. Thank you.
