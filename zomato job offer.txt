University Application Information Gathering for Tutoring Business Hi, thank you for reading this job posting. We are a small company that helps international students apply for top overseas universities. We help the students brainstorm essay ideas, as well as edit the essays and provide interview preparation. Our goal here is to help figure out what each university requires in a student application, so that we can find out how much work the tutor will have to do with their student depending on their university preferences. I am looking for someone who can summarise the requirements for applying to overseas universities, particularly in the United Kingdom and the United States of America. Initially, I will be looking for someone who can find out the following information: - Essay requirements, will they require a personal statement, CV/Resume etc. - How many words are in each essay and what is the topic? If the topic changes or is unknown, say that also. - Is there an interview? How many, who are they with? - What other requirements are there? I am looking for information to be presented in an easy to read format, preferably an excel document which is in a format like this: Oxford University - UCAS admission - 350 word essay on <subject> - 150 word essay on <subject> - Interview with college - etc The purpose of this first part is for us to establish what services a student will need to be delivered by a tutor. If there are multiple essay sections, we need to know that. Also is there anything that this particular that is an addition to the general application? In the United Kingdom for instance, there is the UCAS general application, but then the top schools (like Cambridge and Oxford) require a number of additional essays, interviews etc., that is what we are really looking for. The goal here is for us to be able to quote the student and their families for the correct number of services before we begin. Please note, we are not interested in things like visas, accomodation applications etc, just the academic application side. There is a second part to the proejct also, which involves going on to the university websites and looking for application tips. We are trying to create a document that will help tutors guide students. Basically we want to help tutors and create a handbook they can refer to. I want you to copy and paste as often as you can, cutting out the parts that are not relevant. It is very important that only helpful information is included, along with helpful weblinks to the webpages as well so that the tutor can refer back to where the information came from. Also it needs to have consistant headings so that navigation is easy throughout the document. The applicant will be selected based on their experience, English proficiency, track record and cost. This project will be ongoing, so we need someone that we can trust that can work quickly. In addition, we expect that there will be a large number of applicants, so we will not be considering anyone asking for an unreasonably high rate. More information will follow to the successful applicant! Thank you!
